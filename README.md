Details
-------
This Android library facilitates developers to create Android applications with the functionality of uploading videos to Facebook.

The major features include:
* Shoot new videos or pick videos from gallery for uploading.
* Enter title and description for a video to upload.
* Ask user to confirm before starting uploading.
* Ask user to login to Facebook.
* Show progress of uploading.
* Display video URL after uploading is successfully completed.

Usage
-----

In order to utilize this library, you just need to do some configurations without writing any code.
* Import the FBVideoUploaderSDK module into your Android Studio project. Add dependency to the module to your app project.
* In your app's ```AndroidManifest.xml```, make sure that you have the following permissions:
  * ```android.permission.INTERNET```
  * ```android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE```
  * ```android.permission.CAMERA```
* In your app's ```AndroidManifest.xml```, include the activity:
  * ```com.wms.fbvideouploader.sdk.activity.UploadVideoActivity```
* In your app's ```res/values/strings.xml```,
  * Set ```app_name``` (name of your application).
* Replace your app's ic_launcher icons.
* In order to upload videos to Facebook, you need to register as a Facebook developer and create an app on Facebook Apps Console (https://developers.facebook.com/apps/).
  Follow Facebook's instructions to configure the app. Note that you need to provide your Android app's package name, class name and key hashes. You'll need to ask for the "publish_actions" permission (of course you need to ask Facebook to review and approve your app).
  To get key hash of your Android app, refer to https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started#create_hash.
  Finally, add the Facebook app ID to your app's ```values/strings.xml```.
 
Of course you can modify any components of the library or add new components to customize your Android app's functionality.
